This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to loose comparison using the == operator. The bug.js file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.js provides the corrected version using strict equality (===).  The issue arises from JavaScript's type coercion during loose comparisons, potentially leading to unexpected results. The solution emphasizes the importance of strict equality for reliable comparisons.
